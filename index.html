        <li>Air - O - Grade: [Grade 11]
            <p>
                (Part of AIYA Internship)
                Air-O-Grade is a subscription - based service that uses the given data to predict the concentration of harmful gases. We had
                used Microsoft Azure for our experiments. Data given to us first underwent data cleaning using azure pipelines, which
                removed any null values present in the data set. After which 3 separate models were created using automated machine
                learning, pipelines and python programming to predict the concentration of CO, NO2 and NHMC respectively. Then Mod
                el is deployed allowing us to access the predicted data.
